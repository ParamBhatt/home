		<h1> Build Battles </h1>
		<p> Build Battles is a fun game where you can test your building skills. At the beginning of the game a thing is stated, then you get 5 minutes to build the stated thing. After the 5 minutes are over all the players gather and check over all the builds.
		While checking each build you give each build(except yours) a rating varying from: Super Poop, Poop, Ok, Good, Epic,and Legendary. After all the points are tallied up and the person who received the highest points win. This game can also be played in a doubles,
		variation where you can team up with a partner, to make the best build. This game mode can be played on the server Hypixel, and other variations of this game mode can be found on other servers.</p>
