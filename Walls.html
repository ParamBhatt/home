		<h1> Walls </h1>
		<p> Walls is a great PVP game mode. There are 4 teams in Walls and each team has a cave section. For 5 minutes you gather all the resources from your cave and then the Walls drop. After the Walls drop you  battle it out with other players and destroy their base. Your teams base is found in the center of your territory. 
		This game mode can be played in teams of 2, teams of 4 or even teams of 16. There are different classes in this game mode that provide different perks. An example of this is the healer class which provides you with health potions and golden apples. This game mode is one of the original Minecraft game modes. </p>
