		<h1> UHC (ULTRA HARDCORE)</h1>
		<p> UHC is a competitive  Minecraft game mode where you can truly test your skills. In UHC you cannot naturally regenerate health. The only ways to regenerate health is by making health/regeneration potions or golden apples. In UHC you start of with nothing and like single player you mine resources to get enough materials, but unlike single player you battle it out with other players.
		UHC is one of the only PVP game modes where you have both aspects of PVP and single player. One popular player of this game mode is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xNestorio"> Xnestorio. </a> This game mode can
		be played on Badlion, Hypixel, Minplex, and other servers. This game can be played solo, or in teams of 2 or teams of 4.</p>
